      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Tim Berners Lee dreamt of a World Wide Web that would be free and
        accessible to everyone. Sadly, the modern web is littered with poorly
        designed websites and difficult to navigate code (for both developers
        and users). This often comes down to a lack of understanding around
        different user needs. Designing pages that are accessible for everyone
        shouldn’t be too difficult. The developers at Tech Returners News have
        collated an ‘easy wins' checklist for Web page accessibility.

        Keep this guide handy... When creating your own websites you can check
        these criteria off the list!
