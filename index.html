      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Tim Berners Lee dreamt of a World Wide Web that would be free and
        accessible to everyone. Sadly, the modern web is littered with poorly
        designed websites and difficult to navigate code (for both developers
        and users). This often comes down to a lack of understanding around
        different user needs. Designing pages that are accessible for everyone
        shouldn’t be too difficult. The developers at Tech Returners News have
        collated an ‘easy wins' checklist for Web page accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep this guide handy... When creating your own websites you can check
        these criteria off the list!

      <h2>Accessibility Checks:</h2>
      <p>
        Heading elements & Page Titles: HTML heading elements have been used to
        represent page structure, supporting assistive technologies that allow
        page navigation from heading to heading.
      </p>
      <p>
        Re-size Text: You can vary text size by using your browser's text resize
        settings (through Options or Preferences), text-only zoom, page zoom
        (which also zooms images, buttons etc) without incurring styling issues
        / text over-lapping or being cut off the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternative text for images: All images have been given appropriate
        alternative text.
      </p>
      <p>
        Link text: All hyperlinks should make sense when read out of context,
        and hyperlinks are clearly presented in a different text style from
        normal body text. If a link opens in a new browser page, it has been
        labelled as doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript independence: Where JavaScript or other scripts are used for
        navigation or functionality, an alternative mechanism has been put in
        place in case your browser does not support these scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Colour contrast: has been checked for text and background colour
        combinations to ensure that the contrast is sufficient and I have also
        ensured that information is not referenced by colour alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Style sheets: If style sheets are not supported or are turned off,
        information on the site can still be accessed and read.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forms: forms are marked up correctly so people can interact with them
        using only the keyboard, voice input or screen readers. The form labels
        themselves are clickable, increasing the target area and making it
        easier to select small radio buttons of checkboxes.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        By spending just a little more time on getting the building blocks of
        the web right, developers can help create an Internet that works for
        <em>everyone.</em>
